### What is <i>s<sup>3</sup>hark</i>

<i>s<sup>3</sup>hark</i> is the acronym of site-specific seismic hazard analysis and research kit.
This tool focuses on simulating wave propagation along soil depth using finite element (FE) method.
The intended audience for <i>s<sup>3</sup>hark</i> is researchers and practitioners interested in 
performing site-specific analysis of soil in response to earthquakes, and educators interested in 
teaching site response analysis in their classes. The tool provides a friendly interface for users
to input and modify soil layers using tables, while the built soil profile and the FE mesh being
visualized simultaneously. Results including acceleration, velocity, displacement, pore pressure, spectral acceleration, etc., 
are visualized for the soil profile and for each node as well, from which the user can comprehend the 
wave propagation and liquefaction status along the soil depth.
